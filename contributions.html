                    <p>My journey as a Teaching Assistant at International Friends School (IFS) in Bellevue has been a transformative experience, deeply enriching my understanding of the principles embodied in the Education, Communities, and Organizations (ECO) program. This role has allowed me to engage with students on a fundamental level, applying theoretical knowledge to create real-world impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>Working at IFS, I have embraced a strength-based approach to education, recognizing and nurturing the unique abilities of each student. This perspective has allowed me to see the potential in every child, fostering a supportive environment where diversity is celebrated and individual strengths are highlighted. By focusing on their capabilities rather than limitations, I've helped build a classroom culture that encourages growth and self-confidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>Understanding the historical and cultural backgrounds of my students has been crucial in my teaching. I strive to integrate these perspectives into my lessons, making the curriculum more relatable and enriching for them. This approach not only broadens their horizons but also instills a sense of pride and respect for their own and others' cultures. Reflecting on how identity and privilege impact educational experiences has been eye-opening, guiding my efforts to make ethical decisions that ensure all students receive the support they need to thrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Listening and observing have become fundamental aspects of my teaching philosophy. By truly understanding the needs and concerns of my students, I can tailor my teaching strategies to support their learning effectively. This attentive approach allows me to differentiate instruction, meeting both individual and group needs. Recognizing the knowledge centers within our community and the power structures at play has helped me create an inclusive learning environment where all voices are valued.
                    </p>
                    <p>My role involves analyzing the structures and systems of learning, ensuring that documentation and assessment processes are fair and inclusive. This constant evaluation helps in recognizing and addressing educational inequities, creating opportunities that level the playing field for all students. By understanding how systemic issues contribute to disparities, I work towards implementing innovative teaching strategies that cater to diverse needs and backgrounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>Receiving and responding to feedback is integral to my growth. Reflecting on personal biases and striving for self-improvement ensures that my teaching practices and leadership skills are always evolving. This journey of self-growth is continuous and deeply fulfilling, as it directly translates into better support for my students.                                            
                    </p>
                    <p>Through my actions at IFS, I strive to promote inclusive practices and advocate for the needs of all students. Creating a supportive environment where every student has the opportunity to succeed is my ultimate goal. My internship at International Friends School has been a profound learning experience, allowing me to apply the ECO programâ€™s learning objectives in meaningful ways. This role has equipped me with the skills and insights needed to advocate for equity in education and to lead with compassion and inclusivity.</p>
