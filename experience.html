                    <p>As a Teaching Assistant at International Friends School in Bellevue, my role has been a cornerstone of my journey within the Education, Communities, and Organizations (ECO) Program. This experience has provided me with invaluable insights into the dynamics of elementary education and the importance of creating a nurturing and inclusive learning environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my position, I facilitate instruction across a variety of subjects, including Mathematics, Chinese, English, Physical Education, and Science. Each day, I prepare educational materials and conduct group activities designed to enhance classroom learning and foster a sense of curiosity and engagement among students. Whether it’s developing innovative lesson plans or assisting with hands-on projects, my goal is to make learning an enjoyable and enriching experience for every child.

                    <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of my role is assisting in the development of student final projects. I have guided students through the process of creating self-written mythology stories and producing AI-generated story videos. These projects not only allow students to express their creativity but also help them develop critical thinking and technological skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>Providing timely feedback to the lead teacher about students' social, emotional, behavioral, and academic progress is another key aspect of my role. By closely monitoring each student's development, I ensure that we can address any challenges promptly and tailor our approach to meet their individual needs. This close interaction with students and teachers has deepened my understanding of the importance of personalized education and the impact it can have on a child’s growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>My time at International Friends School has been a transformative experience, solidifying my commitment to education and equity. It has equipped me with practical skills and a deeper understanding of the educational needs of diverse student populations. This role has been instrumental in shaping my aspirations within the ECO Program, reinforcing my dedication to fostering inclusive educational environments where every student can thrive.</p>
