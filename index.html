                    <h2>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dongni (Amy) Zhuo </h2>
                    <p>My journey in education has been deeply personal and transformative. Growing up in China, I experienced firsthand the power of education to open doors and create opportunities. As a first-generation college student, I navigated the challenges and triumphs of pursuing higher education, driven by a desire to make a difference.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my studies and research, I have delved into the complexities of educational systems and their impact on students. At Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I explored how expressive writing can alleviate test anxiety and enhance academic performance. This research underscored the importance of psychological support in education, a theme that resonates deeply with me.

                    <p>
                        In my professional roles, including as a Teaching Assistant at International Friends School in Bellevue and an intern teacher in China, I have worked directly with students, preparing educational materials, facilitating group activities, and providing feedback on their progress. These experiences have honed my skills and reinforced my commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion for education is rooted in a belief that it is a powerful tool for change. I am committed to addressing educational inequalities and empowering students from all backgrounds to achieve their potential. Education has profoundly shaped my life, and I am dedicated to ensuring that others have the same opportunity to succeed and thrive.
